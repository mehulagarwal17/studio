/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the CodeSight application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user with the matching userId can access this data.
 * - /users/{userId}/codeSnippets/{codeSnippetId}: Stores code snippets created by a specific user. Only the owning user can access these.
 * - /users/{userId}/codeSnippets/{codeSnippetId}/executionTraces/{executionTraceId}: Stores execution traces for code snippets. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Default security posture is strict owner-only access. Any deviation requires explicit justification and code.
 * - Data validation during write operations is limited to authorization-critical fields.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The data structure inherently denormalizes the user ID by nesting all data under /users/{userId}.
 *   This allows for efficient path-based authorization without requiring additional reads.
