# **App Name**: CodeSight

## Core Features:

- Code Input and Storage: Allows users to input Python code via text entry or paste and stores it temporarily for execution.
- Secure Code Execution: Executes the user-provided Python code in a sandboxed environment to prevent system access or damage. Captures runtime state.
- Execution Trace Capture: Captures the state of the program at each step of execution, including line number, variable values, call stack, and output. This data feeds the visualization tool.
- Interactive Visualizer: Generates an interactive, animated visualization of the code execution, allowing users to step forward, backward, pause, resume, and scrub through execution steps.
- Variable and Object Exploration: Allows users to expand variables and click objects within the visualization to explore their internal state and references in memory.
- Intelligent Explanation Tool: An AI powered tool automatically generates explanations for each step, such as variable assignments or object creation. This explanation assists with understanding.
- AI-Powered Contextual Guidance: Offers contextual tool for the code, highlighting potential errors or areas for improvement and linking to relevant documentation or learning resources.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft indigo (#667EEA) to create a calm, intellectual learning atmosphere. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F7FAFC) to provide a clean and modern feel that's easy on the eyes during long study sessions.
- Accent color: Vibrant cyan (#4DC0B5) for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention to key changes in the code.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look; good for both headers and body text.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospaced sans-serif to clearly display code snippets
- Use a set of minimalist icons that represent the various steps in code execution such as variables, function calls, and data structures. 
- Fluid and subtle animations to indicate state changes. Variable updates, line executions, and flow control transitions should be animated.
